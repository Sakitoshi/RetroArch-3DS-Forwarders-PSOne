# RetroArch-3DS-Forwarders
Fork of RetroArch modified to make 3DS forwarders with it.


Compile it using **make -f Makefile.ctr**

You'll need **devkitARM_r45**, **aemstro**, [**libctru_1.1_mod**](https://github.com/Sakitoshi/ctrulib_1.1_mod), and the current core you want to make a CIA of compilled and named **libretro_ctr.a** on the root.

**make -f Makefile.ctr -clean** compiles the RomFS, so just run that before compilling.
